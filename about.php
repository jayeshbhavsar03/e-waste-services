                                <h4>Reducing Waste</h4>
                                <p class="font-weight-bold" > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most effective of the 3R Mantra’s. The best way of e-waste management
                                    isto not produce it. Refusing to buy into the latest fad and reducing your
                                    consumption can have a big effect on your e-waste footprint. Reducing the amount of
                                    waste you produce is the best way to help the environment. Buy a product only when
                                    there is a dire need for it. Donate just chase the fashion and trend.</p>
                                    <br>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold" >Reuse Program</h4>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Mantra’s trash is another treasure. Reusing prevents new resources from entering
                                    into the consumption phase and old resources from entering into the waste stream.
                                    When you really need something new, think about who could benefit and re-use your
                                    old technology and appliance by donating the outdated electronics to better use.
                                    with that we are reputed to old computer buyers in the city.</p>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold" >Recycle More</h4>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like The Midas Touch which converts anything into gold, the process of recycling
                                    converts the hazardous waste (old computer, laptop, pc, printers, CPU, electronics,
                                    etc) and scrap into a usable form giving it a rebirth. E-waste recycling is the last
                                    and most effective way of disposing your e-waste in an eco-friendly manner. When you
                                    recycle, you stop solid and hazardous waste going to landfill saving the natural
                                    resources which can be used to manufacture new products and reduce the use of raw
                                    materials.</p>
